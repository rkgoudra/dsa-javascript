Data Structures &amp; Algorithms in JavaScript — curated practice by a Lead MERN Engineer revisiting fundamentals with performance, clarity, and real-world relevance.

# Data Structures & Algorithms — JavaScript

This repository contains my personal implementation of **Data Structures and Algorithms using JavaScript**, created while revisiting core CS fundamentals as a **Lead Software / System Engineer (5+ years experience) working primarily with the MERN stack**.

The goal of this repository is **not competitive programming**, but to strengthen:
- problem-solving clarity
- algorithmic thinking
- time & space complexity awareness
- clean, readable, production-quality JavaScript

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Refresh core DSA concepts with a **software engineering mindset**
- Practice writing **clear, maintainable JavaScript**, not just “accepted” solutions
- Build a reusable reference for interviews, reviews, and mentoring
- Revisit fundamentals that matter for **scalable backend and system design**

---

## 🧠 Approach & Philosophy

Each solution focuses on:
- **Correctness first**
- **Optimal time & space complexity**
- **Readable code with meaningful variable names**
- **Clear explanation of the approach**
- **Why this solution works**, not just how

Where relevant, trade-offs between approaches are mentioned.

## 🧩 Solution Format

Each file generally follows this structure:

```js
/*
Problem: Two Sum
Pattern: Hash Map
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Approach:
- Iterate once through the array
- Store visited elements in a map
- For each element, check if the complement exists
- Return indices when found

Why it works:
- Reduces brute-force O(n²) search to O(n)

## 🧠 Architect’s final advice (important)

This README does 3 things silently:
1. **Establishes seniority** (without bragging)
2. **Explains intent** (not grinding, refining)
3. **Frames DSA as engineering, not exams**

If a recruiter or senior engineer opens this repo, the reaction will be:
> “This person knows what they’re doing.”

---

If you want next:
- A **senior-style commit message convention**
- A **DSA + System Design pairing roadmap**
- A **README badge / polish version**
- Or a **separate “Interview Notes” repo structure**

Say the word — I’ll be ruthless and precise 😌
