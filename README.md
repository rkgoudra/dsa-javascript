# Data Structures & Algorithms — JavaScript

This repository contains my personal implementation of **Data Structures and Algorithms using JavaScript**, created while revisiting core CS fundamentals as a **Lead Software / System Engineer (5+ years experience) working primarily with the MERN stack**.

The goal of this repository is **not competitive programming**, but to strengthen:
- problem-solving clarity
- algorithmic thinking
- time & space complexity awareness
- clean, readable, production-quality JavaScript

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Refresh core DSA concepts with a **software engineering mindset**
- Practice writing **clear, maintainable JavaScript**, not just “accepted” solutions
- Build a reusable reference for interviews, reviews, and mentoring
- Revisit fundamentals that matter for **scalable backend and system design**

---

## 🧠 Approach & Philosophy

Each solution focuses on:
- **Correctness first**
- **Optimal time & space complexity**
- **Readable code with meaningful variable names**
- **Clear explanation of the approach**
- **Why this solution works**, not just how

Where relevant, trade-offs between approaches are mentioned.

Problems are grouped by **data structure / pattern**, not by platform.

## 🧩 Solution Format

Each file generally follows this structure:

```js
/*
Problem: Two Sum
Pattern: Hash Map
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Approach:
- Iterate once through the array
- Store visited elements in a map
- For each element, check if the complement exists
- Return indices when found

Why it works:
- Reduces brute-force O(n²) search to O(n)
*/
```

## Tech Stack
- Language: **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- Runtime: **Node.js**
- Paradigm: **Iterative + Recursive** where appropriate

## Who This Repo Is For
- Engineers revisiting DSA after real-world experience
- Backend / Full-stack developers preparing for interviews
- Developers who value clarity over clever hacks
- Anyone learning DSA in JavaScript with a practical mindset

## Note
- This is a living repository — solutions may be refactored as understanding improves
- Focus is on fundamentals, not language tricks
- No copy-paste from platforms — each solution is implemented and reviewed personally

## Contributions
-This is a personal learning repository, but discussions and suggestions are welcome.
